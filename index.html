            <h1>Hello, I am Colm!</h1>
            <p>
                It started with a fish, or more accurately a shark. This was not
                a real shark but a drawing of one that I poured a hours into.
                Even at ten years old I recall thinking 'Interesting, that shark
                was not there before and now it is'. A basic realisation, but
                it's how I view the world and my ability to create and develop
                within it.</p>

            <p>
                This is the core function that drives me, to raise the
                bar for myself, to take a risk or three. If I can help a friend
                or a colleague or a stranger then I will try. I remember people
                who have helped me and I owe many an awful lot. My aims are to
                communicate service and information through product design and to
                surround myself with the smartest people I can find. </p>

            <p>
                I am a passionate engineer of experiences and strive to improve every
                project I am involved in, I also try to understand when not to
                improve projects. I consider myself adept at Web Development,
                Product Design & User Experience, Web Design, Creative Design,
                Flexibility & Teamwork.
