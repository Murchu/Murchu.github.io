        <div class="p-6 mt-6 bg-gray-50">
            <p class="py-2">
                UX & Product Design to me is simply about best serving the needs of current users,
                building the needs of future users, predicting trends and avoiding churn.

            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                There are a lot of ways to set up design teams to do this but this is my approach.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                <ul class="pl-10 mt-6 list-disc">
                    <li class="pb-6"><span class="font-bold ">Research & Research</span> - If you do not know
                        what and who you are building for, the leanest scrum or the most agile project will not help you.
                        I like to test to the point of routine. 
                        I prefer to record interviews and use dovetail to analyze conversations afterwards. 
                        This keeps me in the moment during the interview and not note taking. 

                        Insights and stories can be produced from this so there can be no debate as to what was
                        discussed. I am not interested in a battle of opinions about what was implied. </li>

                    <li class="pb-6"><span class="font-bold ">Testing, Testing & Testing</span> - I also like to
                        validate to the point of routine! I feel that the work UX teams can do in advance, makes dev sprint cycles 
                        easier and eventually reduces pressure on support teams</li>
                    <li class="pb-6"><span class="font-bold ">Team Design</span> - I have found that team structure
                        makes a dramatic difference to whatever process is in place. Embedded designers ( ideally with QA and product ) at the root
                        of teams makes it a smoother cycle. </li>
                    <li class="pb-6"><span class="font-bold ">Design Thinking ( awful term ) </span> - Places like IBM
                        and others have designer at the O level of the business. I think the trend will go that way with designers
                        holding more influence. For me personally, I like to consider all areas of a business withing my reach, I
                        don't mean that I wish them to do what I want thought! <br /> <br /> For example, I want to know the issues
                        support teams are having, If 15% of their time is spent on 'how do I do . . ', that is something a UXer can help with
                        ( research & interviews ). If we can reduce this to 5% month on month then we are improving
                        Product Scores as well as reducing the cost to serve the product.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pb-6"><span class="font-bold ">More Testing</span> - Sorry but I cannot stress it
                        enough! Ideally
                        you include users in the process so the expectation is they will test the product. This of
                        course fosters good will (NPS)
                        and makes the end product better. I also like to run little A/B validations a lot on tools like
                        maze which takes your direct
                        wireframes and records flows, correct and incorrect click, click rates, bounce rates and more.
                        It is important to me to never feel like
                        I know better because I don't.
