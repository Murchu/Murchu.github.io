                        The payslip section of the Access Native App is one of the few features available to most users, 
                        regardless of tiers or packages.

                    <li class="pb-6">
                        For the most part payslips along with a few other HR basics, booking time and team
                        calendars are the primary experience for a large percentage of all users.

                        This is an employee self-serving feature which would allow users to manage

                        Users expect to be notified of payslip delivery, clearly understand the components
                        of a payslip, view, search and print all payslips to date.

                    <li class="pb-6">
                        Considerations should include application speed, communication between 
                        other functions and payslips, notification & printing.

            <p class="py-2">
                Previously, too much attention had been given to the user interface, this design debt left users frustrated
                with what should have been a simple and specific experience.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                Research and feedback showed that users found it difficult to identify what the current payslip was 
                vs a previous one. They also saw the lack of a printing option was a major oversight.
            </p>
            <p class="py-2">
                The user interface is too complex and the user experience is too basic, this needed to be reversed.

                To start, we tried to identify all the potential users of a payslip function and group them into personas.
                I personally like to conduct several user interviews, between 5 & 10 in an ideal world per persona.

                I prefer to record interviews where permitted and use a tool like Dovetail to analyze sentiment and content after. 
                dovetailDovetail can helpfully do some of this work for me but I will alway comb the transcript myself.
