                        The payslip section of the Access Native App is one of the few features available to
                        most users, regardless of tiers or packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the most part payslips along with a few other HR basics, booking time and team
                        calendars are the <span class="font-medium">primary experience</span> for a large percentage of all users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an employee self-serving feature which would allow users to manage
                        all aspects of a historically paper payslip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users expect to be notified of payslip delivery, clearly understand the components
                        of a payslip, view, search and print all payslips to date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considerations should include application speed, communication between
                        other functions and payslips, notification & printing.

                        the fact.
                        But of course in reality you must wear many hats and I often assist with the physical design

                    <p>
                        Previously, too much attention had been given to the user interface, this design debt left users
                        frustrated with what should have been a simple and specific experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Research and feedback showed that users found it difficult to identify what the current payslip
                        was vs a previous one. They also saw the lack of a printing option was a major oversight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user interface is too complex and the user experience is too basic, this needed to be
                        reversed.

                        personas. I personally like to conduct several user interviews, between 5 & 10 in an ideal world per
                        persona.

                    <p>
                        I prefer to record interviews where permitted and use a tool like Dovetail to analyze sentiment
                        and content after.
                        dovetailDovetail can helpfully do some of this work for me but I will alway comb the transcript
                        myself.

                        We created many small users tests which are based on high fidelity prototypes.
                        With these we were able to validate most on the decisions we had to make with test audiences.

                        This proved very valuable as we uncovered interactions which had not been considered and
                        are in the final product. We found that user testing in this was also reduced the cost to serve
                        as there is no disputing the facts.

                        Understanding the people who would eventually use the product was key from the start.
                        We found that people had very different reasons for wanting their payslips in app but
                        they essentially wanted it the same when they got there. Speed, easy to read & printing.

                    <p>
                        It was re designed several times once we better understood the structural importance.
                        It is better to re design than to build on a mistake.

                        This case study helped me understand how other companies generate business value by
                        implementing great design in both UI and UX. It gives me confidence that if
                        we apply similar principles, and keep doing what we are doing on UX research,
                        our product team can help the company achieve much more success in the near future
