                            The payslip section of the Access Native App is one of the few features available to
                            most users, regardless of tiers or packages.
                        </p>
                        <p>                   
                            For the most part payslips along with a few other HR basics, booking time and team
                            calendars are the <span class="font-medium">primary experience</span> for a large percentage of all users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is an employee self-serving feature which would allow users to manage
                            all aspects of a historically paper payslip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users expect to be notified of payslip delivery, clearly understand the components
                            of a payslip, view, search and print all payslips to date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Considerations should include application speed, communication between
                            other functions and payslips, notification & printing.

                            Previously, too much attention had been given to the user interface, this design debt left users
                            frustrated with what should have been a simple and specific experience.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Research and feedback showed that users found it difficult to identify what the current payslip
                            was vs a previous one. They also saw the lack of a printing option was a major oversight.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                            The user interface is too complex and the user experience is too basic, this needed to be
                            reversed.

                            personas. I personally like to conduct several user interviews, between 5 & 10 in an ideal world per
                            persona.

                            I prefer to record interviews where permitted and use a tool like Dovetail to analyze sentiment
                            and content after.
                            dovetailDovetail can helpfully do some of this work for me but I will alway comb the transcript
                            myself.

                            With detailed analysis of user group it is pretty easy to synthesize large data sets into single

                            We created many small users tests which are based on high fidelity prototypes.
                            With these we were able to validate most on the decisions we had to make with test audiences.

                            This proved very valuable as we uncovered interactions which had not been considered and 
                            are in the final product. We found that user testing in this was also reduced the cost to serve
                            as there is no disputing the facts.

                            This was a pretty small project with large implications for the business but we were constrained
                            by the need to keep the application consistent with the wider design system.

                            time frame. This was not a wheel inventing process.

                            Understanding the people who would eventually use the product was key from the start.
                            We found that people had very different reasons for wanting their payslips in app but 
                            they essentially wanted it the same when they got there. Speed, easy to read & printing.

                            It was re designed several times once we better understood the structural importance. 
                            It is better to re design than to build on a mistake.

                           This case study helped me understand how other companies generate business value by 
                            implementing great design in both UI and UX. It gives me confidence that if
                             we apply similar principles, and keep doing what we are doing on UX research, 
                             our product team can help the company achieve much more success in the near future
