                I joined the company as UX designer on the basis of having a knowledge of Google's Material Design,

                        Very little usability or accessibility testing was done during development or design handoff.
                        We established automated accessibility testing and communicated the value of accessible design
                        accros the application</li>

                        We worked hard to develop a design language which can help the entire business.
                        Design consistency can help reduce the pressure on support teams, improve sales teams on stage

                        implemented a design system for the entire application. Using atomic design principles we

                        consistency and speed to the design and development of the application.</li>

                We went through many iterations of improvised desighn process and came to a conclusion.
                There is no one size fits all soloution, we settled on a simplified version of the below diagram.

                The product suite is large, and we had to change the wheels while the car was on the road so to speak.

                        are,

                        the Jobs To Be DoneUX principle. It basically defines what the key accomplishments

                        journey mapping etc. have been omitted here for brevity but the main part for me is to iterate.
                        Speak to the customers again and again if they are willing. We have found this very useful
                        for improving pNPS score, experience

                We monitor and gather in app feedback on a rolling basis and the overwhelming majority has been
                positive.
                It is of course not all positive but negative feedback is very useful to identify problems sets and
                research target.
