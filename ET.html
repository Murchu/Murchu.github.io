                            Through detailed user research and speaking with users we gained many key insights which helped
                            define any given problem.

                            Recorded interviews with tools like dovetail help analyze what is said in the moment. We then
                            categorized feedback which helps group similar points of view.

                            We monitor and gather in app feedback on a rolling basis and the overwhelming majority has been
                            positive. 
                            It is of course not all positive but negative feedback is very useful to identify problems sets
                            and research target.
